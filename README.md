Hello,

My name is Tarek and I've been working in sales and account management for more than 11 years in different countries.
I always had a knack for programing, and with the COVID stay-at-home situation, I finally gathered the courage to give it a shot. My mind was blown by the possibilities and I was 
determined that the next job I land, is going to be in development.
I've decided to take the plunge and solo-learn programing from scratch.
